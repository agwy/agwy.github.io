Hi there! 

I'm Arne, an enthusiast of using Data-Driven Computational Methods interdisciplinary - think Visualization, Machine Learning and Computational Statistics.

I'm deeply fascinated by learning in all its different forms. From Computer Algorithms that recognise patterns in data and learn how to take effective actions; to Cognitive Psychology, the study of mental processes, and its link to Behavior and Neurology.

Scientific and Engineering often pose questions that can only be addressed with complex data. To me, computational methodology is a main tool to distill meaning with an evidence base from that uncertain and often hard-to-interpret data.

I'll use this website in the future to showcase some examples of how that can be done.

### My background

I started out with a BSc and MSc in Mathematics. I wanted to use the tools learnt there for Science and Engineering, and took this further while being engaged in a Doctoral Training Program in Statistics at the Universities of Warwick and Oxford.

I've often been at the cross-section of different fields. During my Mathematics studies, I looked at the interplay between different subfields of Mathematics and Physics. Doing Statistics research, I was engaged with personalised medicine in a PhD program in Statistics for example. It is a position I cherish, as it allows to make new connections that drive those fields.

My curiosity extends to all aspects of life. I took a break from Machine Learning to explore life working with, and directly for, the needs of other people. It led me to look into [sustainable volunteering](http://blog.grassrootsvolunteering.org/independent-volunteer/). I worked as a [volunteer trek guide](https://www.quetzaltrekkers.com/xela/) in Guatemala for 4 months and travelled to get in touch with people of different backgrounds. 

As self-study projects, I've had a look at Neuroeconomics literature and Reinforcement Learning methodology.

Aside of that, I love climbing, yoga, reading and working with other people.
