Hi there! 

I'm Arne, an enthusiast of the interdisciplinary use of Data-Driven Computational Methods. Think Visualization, Machine Learning and Computational Statistics.

I'm fascinated by learning in all its different forms. From Computer Algorithms that recognise patterns in data and learn how to take effective actions; to Cognitive Psychology, the study of mental processes, and its link to Behavior and Neurology.

Scientific and Engineering often pose questions that can only be addressed with complex data. To me, computational methodology is a main tool to distill meaning with an evidence base from that uncertain and often hard-to-interpret data.

### My background

A BSc and MSc in Mathematics gave me an appreciation for quantitative reasoning and abstraction, and laid bare some common themes in typical constructions that occur in Machine Learning/Statistics and Signal Processing. I took the latter further while being engaged in a Doctoral Training Program in Statistics at the Universities of Warwick and Oxford.

I see Mathematics, Machine Learning and Statistics as tools, that I would like to use to address Scientific and Engineering questions. I've often been at the cross-section of different fields, having for example taken some physics modules during my studies, and being engaged with personalised medicine in a PhD program in Statistics. It is a position I cherish, as it allows to make new connections that drive those fields.

Aside of that, my deep curiosity extends to all aspects of life. I took a break from Machine Learning to explore life working with, and directly for, the needs of other people. It led me to look into [sustainable volunteering](http://blog.grassrootsvolunteering.org/independent-volunteer/). I worked as a [volunteer trek guide](https://www.quetzaltrekkers.com/xela/) in Guatemala for 4 months and travelled to get in touch with people of different backgrounds. 

As self-study projects, I've had a look at some Reinforcement Learning methodology and part of the Neuro-economics literature.
