Hi there! 

I'm Arne, an enthusiast of the interdisciplinary use of Data-Driven Computational Methods. Think Visualization, Machine Learning and Computational Statistics.

I'm fascinated by learning in all its different forms. From Computer Algorithms that recognise patterns in data and learn how to take effective actions; to Cognitive Psychology, the study of mental processes, and its link to Behavior and Neurology.

To be able to deal with the complexity that stems from Scientific or Engineering questions, I see computational methodology as providing a main tool to distill meaning with an evidence base from random and often hard-to-interpret data.
